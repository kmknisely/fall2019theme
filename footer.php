<!-- Another built in function in wordpress, similar to wp_head. This is going to give you access to an admin bar that shows up on top. Why this is in the footer I have no idea but there you go. The admin bar can be turned off in settings. -->
<?php wp_footer();?>

<!-- This is where you close the body and html that you opened in the header.php sheet -->
</body>
</html>
